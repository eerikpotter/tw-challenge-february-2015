Metrics

* For the successful validation of our products, we will be keeping track of some metrics. In example we will probably put counters on the buttons Decline and Confirm as we want to know how many customers trust us to go through with the payment using SoundPay.

* We will be keeping track how many people land on our page or download our app. Although this can be somewhat of a vanity metric as it doesn't show how many people use it either to make a payment or just surveying the product. It's somewhat of a nice to have number to see, how many people are generally interested.

* In the case of a failed payment, we will keep track if the customer will try again or quit using our product completely.

* No. of payments made using our product daily/weekly/monthly
